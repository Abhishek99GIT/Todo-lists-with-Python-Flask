# 🚀 Todo List App — Python & Flask

Welcome to a sleek, no-fuss **To-Do List web app** crafted with **Flask** and **Bootstrap 5**! Built on a cozy Sunday (March 3, 2025), this project was my playground for diving into backend routing, templating, SQLAlchemy, and deploying a Python app on **Render**. It’s simple, functional, and sprinkled with just the right amount of flair.
